# Ggplot and tidyverse workshop

This presentation (made in R markdown, using the [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package). Is based on a tidyverse workshop I followed in 2018 at the University Of Antwerp by Sander Wuyts and Stijn Wittouck. Please check out their presentation and materials when you dive in the wonderful tidyverse [github/swittouck](https://github.com/SWittouck/tidyverse_workshop).
I made their presentation my own and presented it as a workshop to my colleagues at Research Centre Hoogstraten ([Proefcentrum Hoogstraten](https://www.proefcentrum.be/)).
